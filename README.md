For my 12th year coursework I created an educational video, explaining the rendering technique *raymarching* to a non-technical audience.
The graphics were created using the [Motion Canvas](https://motioncanvas.io/ "Motion Canvas Website") Framework and are defined interactively in TypeScript code.

The [3d_renders](3d_renders) folder contains videos greated with a custom raymarching shader in GODOT.
